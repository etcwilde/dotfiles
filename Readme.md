# Configuration

This is the core module of the dot files. This includes the basic configuration file
structure.

# Installation

Installation is made simpler with the `install.sh` file.

Run

`$ ./install.sh`

Which will create symlinks to the corresponding locations in the home directory for
each module.

Note: you will need to locally merge the i3, Vim, git, dunst, and shell branches.

# Todo
