* Introduction

These are my configuration files

* Installation

Installation is made simpler with the `install.sh` file.

Run

`$ ./install.sh`

Which will create symlinks to the corresponding locations in the home directory for
each module.

Note: you will need to locally merge the i3, Vim, git, dunst, and shell branches.
